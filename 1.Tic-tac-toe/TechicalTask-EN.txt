The file contains a completely unfilled or partially filled field of size 3x3 for the Tic-tac-toe game. 
Crosses are marked with "X", zeros with "O", unfilled fields are marked as "-".
It is possible to put "X" or "O" only instead of "-".
It is guaranteed that the playing field is set correctly and that such a game situation can actually occur while playing.

The programme must determine the best move, taking into account whose turn it is now and display the board with the best move made. 
Also in case of a win or draw it outputs "X Win", "O Win" or "Draw".
